This table holds the data of friend acceptance, while requester_id and accepter_id both are the id of a person.
 

Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number under the following rules:

It is guaranteed there is only 1 people having the most friends.
The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multiple records with the same requester_id and accepter_id value.
For the sample data above, the result is:

SELECT
FROM request_accepted t1 JOIN request_accepted t2
ON t1.requester_id=t2.requester_id;

select requester_id as ids from request_accepted
union ALL
select accepter_id from request_accepted;

注意UNION会去掉重复的值，UNION ALL会保留重复的值


SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM (
  SELECT requester_id AS id FROM request_accepted
  UNION ALL
  SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM request_accepted
) as t
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC
LIMIT 1;


Result table:
+------+------+
| id   | num  |
|------|------|
| 3    | 3    |
+------+------+
The person with id '3' is a friend of people '1', '2' and '4', so he has 3 friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
